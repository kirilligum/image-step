The Burner's Essential Guide to a Playa-Proof EMT Shade StructureWelcome to your comprehensive guide for building a durable and reliable EMT (Electrical Metallic Tubing) shade structure for Burning Man. This guide focuses on a standard 10' x 20' flat-top design, which is an excellent starting point for most camps. Read this entire guide before purchasing any materials.Guiding Principles:Strength is Non-Negotiable: The Black Rock Desert is prone to sudden, high-velocity winds. Your structure must be over-engineered to prevent it from becoming a danger to yourself and others.Prep at Home, Assemble on Playa: The single most important phase of this build happens in your driveway or backyard. A test build is not optional.Leave No Trace: From the first metal shaving to the last zip tie, you are responsible for packing out everything you bring.Section 1: Materials & Tools ChecklistThis list is for a 10' x 20' structure with a ~7.5' height.Frame Components (The Skeleton)EMT Conduit (1-inch diameter):(13x) 10-foot lengths of 1" EMT Conduit. This is your frame. 1" is strongly recommended over 3/4" for its rigidity and strength.Canopy Fittings (for 1-inch EMT):(4x) 1" Flat Roof Corner Fittings (3-way)(2x) 1" Flat Roof "T" Fittings (3-way side fitting)(6x) 1" Foot Pads (optional but highly recommended for stability and to prevent legs from digging into the playa)Note: Ensure your fittings are designed for 1" EMT. They often have integrated eye-bolts for tightening, which are essential.Shade & Fasteners (The Skin)Shade Material (10' x 20'):Highly Recommended: 70%-90% Aluminet or black mesh shade cloth. This material breathes, significantly reducing wind load and preventing your structure from turning into a kite.Alternative: Heavy-duty silver/white tarp. Tarps provide rain protection but catch wind dangerously. If you use a tarp, your anchoring system must be flawless.Fasteners:(~100x) 9-inch Ball Bungees. These are used to attach the shade material to the frame. The "give" in the bungee helps absorb wind gusts and prevents your grommets from ripping out.Anchoring System (The Most Critical Part)Playa Anchors:(8-10x) 14-inch or 18-inch long, 1/2-inch or 5/8-inch diameter Lag Bolts. These are the gold standard for securing structures on the playa.Hardware:(8-10x) Washers that fit your lag bolts. These prevent the ratchet strap hooks from slipping off the bolt head.Tensioning:(6-8x) Heavy-Duty Ratchet Straps. These will run from the top corners and mid-points of your structure down to the lag bolts, providing critical diagonal bracing against the wind.Essential Tools & Safety GearImpact Driver (18V or higher): With a socket that matches your lag bolts. An absolute necessity for driving lag bolts into the hard-packed playa. Don't leave home without it and its charger.EMT Conduit Cutter: A simple pipe cutter works perfectly.Metal File: To de-burr the sharp edges of the conduit after cutting. This is a crucial LNT and safety step.Permanent Markers or Paint Pens (Multiple Colors): For labeling all your parts.Tape MeasureWork Gloves & Safety GlassesSection 2: Phase 1 - Pre-Playa Preparation (Do This at Home!)This is where you guarantee your success on the playa.Cut Your Legs: Your 10' conduit poles will be used for the roof. You need to create shorter legs for the height. A height of 7' to 8' is common.Take 3 of your 10' conduit poles.Carefully measure and cut them into (6x) ~7.5-foot leg pieces. (This will leave you with small leftover pieces to recycle at home).De-burr every cut! File down the sharp inside and outside edges until they are smooth. Do not create MOOP (Matter Out Of Place).The Home Build (Test Assembly):On a flat surface, lay out your (7x) 10-foot poles and your fittings to create the 10' x 20' roof frame on the ground.Insert the poles into the fittings and tighten the eye-bolts. Make sure everything fits snugly.With a friend, lift one of the long sides and insert the three legs. Then, lift the other side and repeat.Check that the structure stands level and that all connections are secure.Label Everything!This is the step that will save you hours of frustration on the playa.Use your colored markers or paint pens. Create a simple system.Example: Mark all roof poles with Red. Mark all leg poles with Blue.At each connection point, draw a matching line or symbol across the fitting and the pole. When you reassemble, you just line up the marks. It's foolproof.Pack Smart:Bundle your labeled poles together with tape or straps.Put all your fittings, bungees, and hardware in a clearly labeled, durable bin.Section 3: Phase 2 - On-Playa Assembly & AnchoringSite Selection: Find a flat, clear area. Note the prevailing wind direction if possible.Assemble the Roof: Just like at home, assemble the 10'x20' roof frame on the ground. Tighten the eye-bolts on the fittings.Attach the Shade Cloth: Drape your Aluminet or tarp over the frame. Use a few ball bungees on each corner to hold it in place, but keep it loose for now.Raise The Structure:With at least two people, stand on the inside of the frame on one of the 20' sides.Lift the frame up and have a third person (or one of you) insert the three leg poles into the fittings on that side.Walk to the other side and repeat the process. The structure is now standing!Position and Square Up: Adjust the structure's position as needed. Make sure it's as square as possible.Secure Bungees: Attach the rest of your ball bungees, spacing them evenly through every grommet. They should be snug, but not banjo-string tight.Section 4: Phase 3 - Anchoring for High Winds (Do Not Skip!)Drive the Lag Bolts:Using your impact driver, drive a lag bolt into the playa about 4-6 feet out from each corner, at a 45-degree angle away from the structure.Add at least one more lag bolt along each long (20') side.Leave about 2-3 inches of the bolt head and washer exposed.Attach Ratchet Straps:Hook one end of a ratchet strap to the top of a corner fitting.Hook the other end to the corresponding lag bolt. The strap should form a clean diagonal line.Repeat for all corners and side anchor points.Tensioning:Go around the structure and slowly tighten each ratchet strap.The goal is to apply even, downward pressure from all directions. The structure should feel solid and have no wobble. Do not overtighten, as this can bend the EMT poles. It should be taut, not strained.Daily Checks:Wind and temperature changes can cause straps to loosen. Check your straps and anchors every single day. A few clicks on the ratchet can make all the difference in a windstorm.Congratulations! You have built a strong, reliable playa shade structure. Now you can relax and enjoy the Burn, knowing you and your gear are safe and shaded.
