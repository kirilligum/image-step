Master Prompt:
"Create a minimalist, black and white line art illustration in the style of an IKEA instruction manual. The image must have:

Style: Clean, simple, and precise black lines on a stark white background.

Color: Strictly black and white only. No color, no gradients, no grayscale, no shading.

Perspective: A clear isometric or 3/4 view that makes the objects and connections easy to understand.

Focus: The image should only contain the specific parts and tools relevant to the step. No backgrounds, no environments, no shadows, no text or written labels.

Visual Cues: Use dotted lines to show alignment or how parts connect. Use solid arrows to show the direction of movement, insertion, or rotation. Use circular callouts to magnify small, important details.

Human Figure: If a person is required, depict a simple, friendly, gender-neutral, stylized line-art character.

The final image should be clear, easy to interpret, and focused entirely on the assembly action."




strict constraints for illustrators to ensure absolute visual consistency across all images, regardless of who creates them.

1. Line Work

Line Weight: All lines must have a single, uniform weight (e.g., 2pt). There should be no variation in thickness for outlines, details, or action lines.

Line Style: Use only solid, 100% black strokes. No brushes, textures, tapering, or artistic effects.

Line Caps & Joins: All line endings must be flat/butt caps. All corners must be sharp miter joins. No rounded caps or joins.

2. Color and Shading

Palette: The only colors permitted are Black (#000000) and White (#FFFFFF).

Fill: All shapes must have a solid white fill or no fill.

Shading: Do not use gradients, shadows, grayscale, hatching, or any other form of shading. The style is strictly flat line art.

Exception: The "De-burr" step requires a simple, flat red for the 'X' and a simple, flat green for the checkmark. These are the only exceptions in the entire instruction set.

3. Perspective and Composition

Projection: All illustrations must be drawn in a consistent isometric projection. Do not use any other perspective (e.g., one-point, two-point, or flat elevation).

Layout: Center the primary subject of the step. Maintain a generous margin of white space around all elements. Avoid placing objects too close to the edge of the frame.

Simplicity: Only include objects and components that are directly involved in the current step. Do not add background details, environments, or unnecessary clutter.

4. Objects and Components

Model Sheet: Before starting, reference a master model sheet (to be created) for all recurring components (EMT poles, fittings, lag bolts, bungees, tools). Every instance of a component must look identical across all illustrations.

Simplification: Render objects with the minimum amount of detail required for them to be clearly identifiable. Focus on clean, geometric shapes.

5. Graphical Cues

Action Arrows: Use solid black, filled, simple triangular arrowheads. Use these to indicate direct motion (inserting, tightening, pushing).

Alignment/Path Lines: Use dashed black lines with a consistent dash and gap length (e.g., 4px dash, 4px gap). Use these to show where a part will be positioned.

Circular Callouts: To magnify a detail, encircle the area with a thin, solid black line. Lead a straight line from this circle to an enlarged view, which should also be contained within a larger circle.

Quantity Notations: Use a simple, bold, sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica Bold, Arial Bold) for quantity markers like "x6". This is the only acceptable use of text.

6. Stylized Human Figure ("The Assembler")

Construction: Build the character from simple geometric shapes: a circle for the head, ovals or rectangles for the torso and limbs.

Features: The character should be gender-neutral and featureless. No hair, ears, or mouth. If showing emotion is necessary (as in the "De-burr" step), simple dot eyes or a simple curve for a mouth is acceptable.

Hands: Depict hands in their simplest formâ€”a "mitten" shape with a thumb is often sufficient to show grip and action. Avoid drawing individual fingers unless absolutely necessary for clarity.
